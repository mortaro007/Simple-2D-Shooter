# Simple-2D-Shooter

A rather simple and fun 2D Shooter with a health bar and enemies. Inspiration taken from Geometry Wars.

The player will look in the direction in which the mouse is pointing and shoot in the same direction. Movement won't change depending on the player angle, it will always be the same.

Enemies will follow you and once they touch the player, one point from the health bar will disappear. Be careful as you may only be touched 4 times before you die.

You can shoot basically everywhere but you only have one bullet until a certain range, or if the bullet touches a wall / an enemy.
As soon as the bullet collides with the enemy, it will respawn and you will be able to shoot again.

As for the score, you'll get one point for each killed enemy. Once the game is over and the app closes, the high score will be displayed in the console.
Also, be careful as you can't pass through walls or escape the playing area, the player will collide with everything.

Use WASD to move, left click to shoot and score as many points as you can!
